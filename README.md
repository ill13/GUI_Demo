# GUI_Demo

A demo using PySimpleGUI and using only:

- Built-in functions
- A little TKinter code for styling



Demonstrating:

- 'Material' design colors
- Button sizes and design based on Material 
- UI design inspired by the Win10 UI
- *Dark* and *Light* themes
- Matching themed pop-up windows
- Circular Progress bar

Basically, this is a 'framework' using bunch of 'presets' to ease theming to match my interpertation of a mix of web and win10 UIX
